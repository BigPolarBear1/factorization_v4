# factorization_v4

For the current fastest version, look at v3 (which is also still a work in progress as I rewrite that project to C).

Making a new repo here because I want to revisit what I was doing earlier.

So creating a hashmap with linear coefficient pairings for different quadratic coefficients... I will upload an older PoC from a few months ago here again tomorrow... but I just keep having this nagging feeling that there has to be a way to quickly solve that. Using linear algebra. 

Because it really boils downs to finding a coefficient that is a solution every prime at a certain quadratic coefficient (or iN) value...  and since we can precalculate all this stuff... there just has to be an easy way to figure these things out. 
I just really keep having this nagging feeling in my stomach that I missed something there.... and I think because it is so different from quadratic sieve, I gave up too early without fully exploring what I could do with it. So while I rewrite v3 in C, I will also begin a deeper exploration of this.
